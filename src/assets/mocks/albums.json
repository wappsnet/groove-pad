    "description": "The album starts out with one of the better songs called “Good Fight,” which contains funky clean guitars, distorted bass, crashing drums and an undeniable 80’s vibe that shows itself during the chorus. It also explores a Franz Ferdinand type vibe that works. “Do Ya” isnt too shabby either. It is high octane energy fueled that goes a bit overboard at times but nonetheless might get you in the mood to chug a couple of more beers with guys before painting the town red. “Brightlife” is a straightforward rock song that turns into a techno song for about two seconds. There is also a scatting/rap part that comes out of nowhere. By the end of the song I was getting the feeling that it was trying to appeal to too many people.",
